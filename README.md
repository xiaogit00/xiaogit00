### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### About Me:
Making things has always been my chief obsession. I got my BA in Social and Political Science from Cambridge University in 2018, and an MSc in Digital Fintech at the National University of Singapore in 2023. Largely self-taught, I started my journey building websites with PHP, HTML, CSS, and Laravel 10 years ago, and gradually traded my tools for Typescript/React/Express. Extremely inspired by the likes of LeiJun (CEO, Xiaomi) and Paul Graham. I am currently building a team - if you're a designer, engineer, or someone with product ideas, do reach out.
